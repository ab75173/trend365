#Trend365

##General Assembly WDI June 2014

##Overview

Does the media play favorites? Is it liberal? Conservative? Are journalists coddling leaders they should be holding accountable?
Trend365 offers you unprecedented article-by-article analysis answering just these questions. We've parsed the news and brought underlying sentiment to light, representing positive and negative coverage with vibrant bar graphs.
Are topics you care about getting a fair shake? [See for yourself](http://nyt-sentiment.herokuapp.com/ "See for yourself").

Trend365 is a web application that allows users to enter search terms and see related New York Times articles along with a graph visualization that displays negative and positive sentiment trends relating to those keywords.

Trend365 was developed for a group project for the April 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. It was developed over a two-day sprint to model the agile software development process.
